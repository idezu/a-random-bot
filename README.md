# How do I use this thing?
The default prefix is `.`, however you can easily change the prefix with `.prefix [new prefix]`. If you forget the prefix, just `@mention` RoboLiam and you'll get the server prefix. To see the commands, say `.help` or if you'd like, you can say `.cmds`! Many of RoboLiam's commands have aliases so you don't have to step out of your confort zone!

# I found a bug!
If you come across a bug or need support in general, [join the support server](https://discord.gg/fssWDHY5Kb). An invite to the support server is listed above.

# I've got an idea!
You have an idea for a new command or feature? GREAT! Similar to if you find a bug, [join the support server](https://discord.gg/fssWDHY5Kb) and tell the developers! We'd be more than happy to listen to what you have to say.
