# How do I use this thing?
The default prefix is `//`, however you #will can easily change the prefix with `//prefix [new prefix]`. To see the commands, say `//help`!

# I found a bug!
it's my first project so i don't know everything in js, it's maybe better to search on internet and submit the patch

# I've got an idea!
you can tell it to me but it''s not sure that the next update is for that.
